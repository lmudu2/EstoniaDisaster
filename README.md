In this classification project, I need to predict whether the passager survived or not.  As a part of feature engineering, I have started finding missing values wherein the dataset has no missing values. In the dataset, I found there are a lot of categorical variables to convert categorical variables to a numerical variable I took country variable to do one-hot end coding. 
To do so first I find how many unique countries are there in the dataset then I took the top 10 countries and do one-hot encoding for the top 10 countries. Along with the country variable I have done one-hot encoding for the Sex and Category(class) variable. Then I count of the output variable to check whether the dataset is balanced or not. I found that the dataset is an imbalance dataset to make balance I have oversampled the dataset by using SMOTETomek. Now our dataset is ready to fit into the model. 
Initially, I have used LogisticRegression but it does not get the desired accuracy so I have used the KNN model to see that accuracy may increase but still it doesn't. So, i use the elbow method, to get the desired accuracy.
